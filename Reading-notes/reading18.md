# Web Application Threat Modeling with OWASP, DREAD

## Application Threat Modeling
- Threat modeling works to identify, communicate, and understand threats and mitigation's within the context of protecting something of value.
- Threat modeling can be applied to wide range of things like software, application, systems, networks, distributed systems...
- Most of the time threat model includes:
    - descriptions/ design / model of what you worried about
    - A list of assumptions that cna be checked
    - List of potential threats to the system
    - A list of actions to be taken for each threat
    - Away of validating the model and threats and verify its success
- The threat modeling in the SDLC can help
    - Building secure design
    - Efficient investment of resources
    - Brings both application and security together.
    - Evaluate their risk
    - Balance risks, controls, and usability
    - Identifies where control is necessary
    - Document threats and mitigation
    - Ensures that business security is maintained
    - Identifies security test cases
- Steps of designing threat model
    1. Find your why and what are you building
    2. Think about edge cases
    3. Turn the findings into action
    4. check to see if what you done had good quality, feasibility, progress, and planning
- In agile environment it is hard to find when would be good time to do a threat modeling if the question of what can go wrong seems clear, then it is good idea to go to drawing board and map out the threat
