# Vulnerability Scanning with Nessus

- The pen testing or vulenrability scanning depends on three factors
    - scope, risk and criticality of assets, and cost and time
- Pen testing requires use of tools, sometimes a lot of tools.
- Pen testing can be application or network level.
One can include whole infrastructure and all applications but that is impractical in the real world.
- Pen testing requires you rate the practicality of the time and cost to the tools that you are going to create to the end client
- Pen testing does have higher than average chance of causing outages
- vulnerability is act of identifying potential vulnerabilities in network devices.
- Vulnerability scanner is not made to find zero day exploits
- Effective way to follow the vulnerability management lifecycle. 
- Vulnerability management can be fed into patch management
- Both vulnerability and pen testing can feed into the cyber risk analysis
- Training and experience is really important to pen testing as depth of knowledge of security tool can bring ROI in terms of quality good vew of org's security posture and reducing cost and time spent on unnecessary troubleshooting.
