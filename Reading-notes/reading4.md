# Identity and Access Management 

## What is IAM? Identity and access management explained

- Once the identity is establish, it has to be maintained 
- The goal of identity management is to allow only needed authorization during the onboarding to offboarding
- IAM tools: There are monitoring tools like sharepoint to office 365
- API security: Enables IAM for use with B2B commerce
- IA: stop risky identity behaviors using rules, machine learning and statistical algo
- Repeatable ways to govern the identity life cycle
- IAM System should be able to accommodate the complexities of today's computing environment.
- Identity-as-a-service has evolved as third party to manage on prem and cloud service
- Identity management helps with lowers the risk of threats of ransomware, criminal hacking, phishing and other malware attacks.
- Robust IAM system can manage and protect against threat
- IAM can help with organization with complying on regulation
- IAM can help user to access company data without compromising security.
- IAM can lower the number of help-desk calls
- Well manage IAM means greater control of user access
- There are four basic elements when it comes to IAM
    1. Directory of the personal data the system uses to define individuals
    2. A set of tools for adding, modifying and deleting that data
    3. A system that regulates user access
    4. auditing and reporting system
- regulating user access has traditionally invovled a number of authentication methods: including passwords, digital certificates, tokens, and smart cards
- With advance in technology having just password authentication is not enough.  
- Multi-factor authentication
    - Context aware network access control is policy-based and it predetermines an event as well as its outcome based on various attributes. The higher the risk, it is best to restrict authentication process.
- Federated Identity Management let you share your authentication with trusted partner. It allows users to gain access to ore than one network.
- Single Sign on is an important part of federated ID management, it let you authenticate one network and carry over to another.
- Authorization sends message using `Security Assertion Markup Language` (SAML). It achieve interoperability across different vendors.
- Other open-standard identity protocols are OpenID,WS-Trust, and WS-Federation and OAuth
- data-protection was their biggest concern for most of the organization using IAM
- Security prefssionals are also concern about integrating IAM with legacy system, moving to cloud and employee using unapproved technology.
- Access Management: refers to the processes and technologies used to control and monitor network access
- Active Directory: Microsoft software that is developed to manage user
- Biometric authentication: Authenticating identity using fingerprint sensor, iris, and retina scanning and facial recognition
- Context aware network access control is policy based method of granting access to network resource
- Deprovisioning: removing the identity from ID repository 
- Digital identity: ID itself, description of the user and their privileges
- Identity lifecycle management: set of processes and technologies for maintaining and updating digital identities.
- LDAP: open standards based protocol for managing and accessing a distributed directory service
- Risk based authentication: dynamically adjust authentication requirement based on user's situation at given time. 
- SSO: accss control for multiple related but separate system.
- User Behavior analytics: UBA technologies examine patters of user behavior and automatically apply algorithms
