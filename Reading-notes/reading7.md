- Data at rest is data that is not actively moving from device to device
- It is just being stored in drive
- Data at rest aims to secure the data that is inactive.
- Attacker find it more valuable target than data in motion
- To the protection of data in transit, enterprise often choose to encrypt sensitive data prior to moving to protect the data. 
- To the data at rest, enterprise can simply encrypt sensitive files prior to storing them.
- In addition to encryption, best practices for robust data protection is 
    - implement network security controls, such as firewall and network access control.
