# Sniffing and Evasion

## What is sniffing
- Sniffing is a process of monitoring and capturing data packets
- Sys admin and network admin utilize sniffers to monitor external threat.
- Attackers use sniffer to capture data packets and containing sensitive information such as password. 
- By placing a packet sniffer on network in promiscuous mod, a malicious intruder can capture an analyze all of the network.
- Active sniffing: sniffing at switch. Actively inject traffic into the LAN to enable sniffing of the traffic.
- Passive sniffing: process of sniffing through hub. any traffic that goes through the hub is operating at the data layer of the network. All of the data packet that passes hub is transmitted to all of the device in the network. Passively waits for data packet to be sent.
