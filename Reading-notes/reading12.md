# Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)

- Network intrusion detection system (NIDS) 
- What is intrusion detection system?
    - An intrusion detection 
- IDS can notify security measure when there is infections, spyware or key loggers, as well as accidental information leakage.
- Intrusion Detection systems vs Intrusion prevention system
    - IPS is similar to IDS, except they are able to block potential threat as well. 
    - They are able to stop incoming threat without getting the system admin involved
    - If IPS is not configured correctly, it can also deny legitimate traffic so they are not suitable for all application.
- Network intrusion detection systems vs host intrusion detection system
    - NIDS and an HIDS are complementary system that differ by the position
- NIDS has quicker response tme than the HIDS and they are also easier to implement
- As they do not needs software loaded and managed at the different hosts in the network.
- Another benefit of an NIDS is that they detect incidents in real-time.
- NIDS allow for quicker response.
- Pros of Network Intrusion Detection System:
    - firewall can show you information between two hosts, but NIDS can tuned to show you the specific content within the packet.
    - This can be used to prevent intrusion such as exploitation attacks or compromise endpoint device.
    - The sensor an look for both TCP and UDP protocols.
    - IDS can analyze the amount and types of attacks. This can be used to change your security systems
    - Make it easier to maintain.
    - They cn boost efficiently as data within the network packets and identify the services or operating systems that are being utilized.
- Cons of using Network Intrusion Detection Systems
    - Not prevent incident by themselves so not automating.
    - Needs experienced admin to set it up.
    - Does not process encrypted packets
    - IP packets can still be faked and they can be spoofed
    - False positives are very frequent with NIDS. It can be reduced to tune down the false positives.
    - They are susceptible to protocol based attacks. NIDS can be errored out by protocol analyzer bugs and invalid data
    - Signature library needs t be continually updated.
        - If its not updated routinely, it will not register latest attacks.
