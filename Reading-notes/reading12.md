# Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)

- Network intrusion detection system (NIDS) 
- What is intrusion detection system?
    - An intrusion detection 
- IDS can notify security measure when there is infections, spyware or key loggers, as well as accidental information leakage.
- Intrusion Detection systems vs Intrusion prevention system
    - IPS is similar to IDS, except they are able to block potential threat as well. 
    - They are able to stop incoming threat without getting the system admin involved
    - If IPS is not configured correctly, it can also deny legitimate traffic so they are not suitable for all application.
- Network intrusion detection systems vs host intrusion detection system
    - NIDS and an HIDS are complementary system that differ by the position
- NIDS has quicker response tme than the HIDS and they are also easier to implement
- As they do not needs software loaded and managed at the different hosts in the network.
