## Security Operations Center: Ultimate SOC Quick Start Guide

- Cybersecurity threat is becoming more prominent and is becoming more dangerous and more difficult to detect and mitigate.
- To mitigate, detect and prevent any cyberattack is a purpose of Security Operations Center
- SOC is traditionally a physical facility with an organization
- SOC team are made up of management, security analysts, and sometimes security engineers.
- SOCs are a proven way to improve threat detection, decrease the likelihood of security breaches.
- `CSIRT` computer security incident response team, is responsible for receiving, analyzing, and responding to security incidents.
- CSIRT can work under SOCs or can stand alone
- CSIRT is to minimize and manage damage caused by an incident the CSIRT does not just deal with the attack itself.
    - They also talk to clients,excutives, and the board
- Usually SOC and CSIRT is desirable as a single entity
- Both SOC teams and CSIRT teams use security orchestration, automation, and response tools.
- Collects logs and events from hundreds of security tools and organizational systems and generates actionabl security alerts, which the SOC team can analyze and respond to.
- SOC team has two core responsibilities
    - Maintaining security monitoring tools - Team must maintain and update tools regularly.
    - Investigate suspicious activities - investigate suspicious and malicious activity within the networks and systems
- SOC team has several roles
    - Security analyst - Responsible for detecting potential security threats
    - Security engineer - charge of maintaining and updating tools and systems and is usually a software or hardware specialist.
    - SOC manager - Directs SOC operations, responsible for the SOC team. Responsible for syncing between analysts and engineers, hiring, training, and security strategy.
    - Chief information security officer - establishes security related strategies, policies, and operations. work closely with CEO
    - Director of incident response - responsible for managing incidents in large companies
- SOC analysts are organized in four tiers
    - SIEM alerts flow to Tier 1 analysts who monitor, prioritize and investigate them.
    - Real threats are passed to Tier 2 analysts, who does analysis and decides on a strategy for containment
    - Critical breaches are moved up to a Tier 3 senior analyst, who manages the incdent. Tier 3 analysts are also responsible for actively hunting for threats
    - Tier 4 analyst is SOC manager, in charge of recruitment, strategy, priorities and the direct management of SOC staff
- The benefit of security operation centers 
    - incident response - SOCs operates around the clocks detects and response to the threat
    - Threat intelligence and rapid analysis - Socs use threat intelligence feeds and security tools to quickly address threats
    - Reduce cybersecurity costs - although a SOC represents a major expense, in a long run it reduce the whole some cost of cyber attacks
    - Reduce the complexity of investigations - SOC teams can streamline their investigative efforts. SOC teams have visibility into the network environment so the SOC can simplify the tasks of drilling into logs and forensic information for example.
- Challenges facing security operation centers
    - Increased volumes of security alerts - requires a significant amount of an analysts time. 
    - Management of many security tools- SOC can use more than 20 tools and it can be hard to keep track of and control individually making it important to have a central source and a single platform
    - Resource allocation - staffing or lack of qualified individuals is an issue. Organization may decide to outsource, however, the issue of greater vulnerability that comes with remote working conditions arises.
