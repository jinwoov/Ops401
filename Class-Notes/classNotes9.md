public key encryption 
- pgp pretty good privacy
    - gpg4win <-- software
    - gnupg <--

- We bought public key encryption
    - PGP

- PGP
    - public key encryption
    - PGP confidentiality
    - integrity
    - overall

= PGP - no sharing
-  secret code

- public key encryption
    - public
        - encryption only 
    - private
        - decrypt only
- key pair 
    - david key pair

- mario (sender)
    - hello jake
    - public key

- jake (reciept)
    - hello jake

from sender -> public key(receipt) -> decrypt with private key -> clear text

pgp uses RSA
RSA is on encryption standard

RSA is slow algo
- async encryption


- tools vs text
GPG 4 win
    - PGP
    - RSA crypto system


- GPG4WIn for windows
- GNUPG for linux

- webserver
    - 80 no security
    - 443 SSL 

- PKI

- DATA in motion
    - TLS - 3, 2, 1
    - SSL -

- User on internet -> internet -> Website
- CA: certificate authority/CA

- Asymetric manages non-repudiation, RSA, DSA, PKCS
- Symetric - RSA
