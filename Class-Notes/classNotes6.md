Caesar cypher and they are ABC -> XYZ

ABC - > xyz -> ABC 

- Symmetric encryption: one key performing the encryption and encryption
    - one key that does both encryption and decryption
- Asymmetric 
    - you have two key: public for encryption and private for decryption
- Obscure but has meaning behind the drawing
- DES - known to be able to decrypt so they use 3DES 
- AES - 128,192,256 - sym VPN
- RC4,RC5,RC6
- DH diffie hellman
- MD message digest
- MD5 message digest
- SHA - secure hashing algorithm 1, 2,3, 256
- DSA sym
- PKI certificate
- Important to remember MD5 SHA 1,2,3 
- VPN: DES is obsolete -> 3DES
    - AES 
    - DH
- PKI
- Hashing is payload sits there and generating hash string value - done
    - Hash dumping: dumping the whole hashed strings
- Encryption is 
- Man in the middle attack
    - if you have encryption to the wifi or http or ftp connection to the wifi, then man in the middle can use wireshark to capture the packet
    - if someone performs man in the middle attack then hope is to prevent confidentiality
- Data in transit: if the data is moving then you need to wrap it to the 
- Data in rest: only accessible
