- Symmetric encryption: one key performing the encryption and encryption
    - one key that does both encryption and decryption
- Asymmetric 
    - you have two key: public for encryption and private for decryption
- Obscure but has meaning behind the drawing
- DES - known to be able to decrypt so they use 3DES 
- AES - 128,192,256 - sym VPN
- RC4,RC5,RC6
- DH diffie hellman
- MD message digest
- MD5 message digest
- SHA - secure hashing algorithm 1, 2,3, 256
- DSA sym
- PKI certificate
